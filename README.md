# RedTM
RedTM : a reduced design for a modified Turing Machine (minimal, modern, turing completess)

This is Software Code in "C" programming language for a Turing Machine
automaton with non-sequential memory access for RAMs in place 
of magnetic tapes and a single, universal, NOR operation 
(NOR as universal logic gate), a design chosen applying the Ockham Razor 
(law of parsimony). This is a "Turing complete" system, possibly 
one of the set of minimal designs for doing computations
with Turing completeness.
